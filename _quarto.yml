# Vault-level Quarto Configuration
# Applies to any .qmd file rendered from this vault
#
# MERMAID HANDLING:
# Quarto has BUILT-IN mermaid support via ```{mermaid} code fences.
# Do NOT inject external CDN mermaid scripts -- they conflict with
# Quarto's embedded renderer and break embed-resources (self-contained) mode.
#
# For HTML: Quarto embeds mermaid JS and renders client-side automatically.
# For PDF:  Quarto uses Chromium to convert mermaid to PNG (requires chromium).
# For DOCX: Use the mermaid-to-image Lua filter below.
#
# If a subdirectory needs to override this config, create a local _quarto.yml
# in that directory with `project: type: default` to claim the project root.
