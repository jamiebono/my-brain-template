# AI Writing Patterns to Avoid

This reference catalogs specific AI-generated patterns that make writing feel inauthentic. Use during the de-AI-ify pass.

## Transitions That Scream AI

| AI Pattern | Human Alternative |
|------------|-------------------|
| "Moreover," | Just continue |
| "Furthermore," | And / Also / Or just start the sentence |
| "Additionally," | Delete or use "And" |
| "Nevertheless," | "But" or "Still" |
| "However," (overused) | "But" - or restructure |
| "In essence," | Delete |
| "Ultimately," | Delete or be specific |
| "It's worth noting that" | Just note it |
| "Interestingly," | Let the reader decide |

## Observer Stance (Always Fix)

These phrases position the writer as someone watching from outside rather than stating directly:

- "I see this constantly in..." → State the thing directly
- "I've noticed that..." → Delete, just say it
- "What I've observed is..." → Say what you observed
- "In my experience..." → Sometimes ok, often filler
- "Time and time again..." → Be specific or cut

## Announcement of Emphasis

AI loves to tell you something is important before saying it:

- "That distinction matters:" → Just make the distinction
- "Here's the key insight:" → Just give the insight
- "This is crucial:" → Say the crucial thing
- "The important thing to understand is..." → Understand this:
- "Let me be clear:" → Be clear (without announcing it)

## Rhetorical Patterns

- Question followed immediately by answer → Pick one or create tension
- "Not X, but Y" structure overused → Vary your structures
- Three examples every time → Sometimes two is enough, sometimes four
- Parallel structures back-to-back → One is powerful, two is a pattern

## Corporate/LinkedIn Specific

- "In today's fast-paced world..." → Never
- "Let's dive deep into..." → No
- "At the end of the day..." → Pick a different ending
- "It goes without saying..." → Then don't say it
- "Excited to announce..." → Fine for actual announcements, cringe otherwise
- "Thoughts?" / "Agree?" / "What do you think?" → End with your point

## Hedging Language

- "It's important to note" → Note it
- "It's worth mentioning" → Mention it
- "various" / "numerous" / "myriad" → Be specific or cut
- "arguably" → Argue it or don't
- "somewhat" / "fairly" / "rather" → Usually filler

## Emphasis Patterns

- Italics on abstract concepts (*choice* vs *belief*) → Feels like a TED talk
- Bold for key terms in every paragraph → Let ideas stand alone
- ALL CAPS for emphasis → Almost never appropriate
- "Really" / "Very" / "Truly" → Usually weakens the point

## Sentence Starters to Vary

AI tends to start sentences the same way. If you see these repeating:

- "This..." (3+ times)
- "It..." (as dummy subject)
- "There is/are..."
- "The..." (every sentence)

Mix in:
- Action verbs first
- Subject variety
- Fragments (when they work)
- Questions (sparingly)

## The "Read It Out Loud" Test

If a sentence sounds weird spoken aloud, it's probably AI-influenced:

❌ "The paradigm shift necessitates a fundamental reimagining of our approach."
✅ "This changes how we need to think about it."

❌ "It becomes evident that the implementation presents challenges."
✅ "The implementation is hard."
