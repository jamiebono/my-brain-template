# Agent Handoff Log

Context preservation for agent-to-agent delegation. The Strategic Advisor writes here before delegating to other agents, ensuring no context is lost.

## Format

Each handoff entry should include:

```markdown
### [Date] [From Agent] → [To Agent]

**Context:** Why this handoff is happening
**Discoveries:** Key findings so far
**Desired Outcome:** What the receiving agent should produce
**Relevant Files:**
- `path/to/file1.md`
- `path/to/file2.md`

**Status:** Pending | In Progress | Complete
```

## Active Handoffs

*No active handoffs.*
