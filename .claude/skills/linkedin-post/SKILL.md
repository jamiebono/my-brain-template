# LinkedIn Post Writer

Create LinkedIn posts in your authentic voice - direct, practical, connects ideas to real work.

## Voice Profile

**Core traits:**
- Direct statements, not observations ("Tech has its own version" not "I see this in tech")
- Concrete over abstract (name the thing, don't describe around it)
- Confident without being preachy
- Makes points through examples, not lectures
- Comfortable with incomplete thoughts and natural rhythm

**Sentence patterns:**
- Short punchy sentences mixed with longer ones
- Fragments are fine when they land
- Questions used sparingly, for real effect
- No rhetorical setups ("Here's the thing..." / "Let me explain...")

**What to avoid:**
- Observer stance ("I see this constantly...", "I've noticed that...")
- Announcement of emphasis ("That distinction matters:", "This is important:")
- Italics/bold for emphasis on abstract concepts
- Parallel structures repeated back-to-back
- Generic insight framing ("The key takeaway is...")
- LinkedIn cringe ("Let's connect!", "Thoughts?", "Agree?")
- Hashtag spam (one or two max, only if genuinely relevant)

## Process

### 1. Get the Source Material

If given a URL, fetch it and extract the core insight. If given a topic, clarify what angle to take.

### 2. Find the Hook

What's the specific, concrete thing that makes this interesting? Start there, not with context.

**Good openings:**
- A specific practice or fact (not "In today's world...")
- A question that isn't rhetorical
- A direct statement of position

### 3. Draft in Voice

Write 150-300 words. LinkedIn rewards substance but punishes walls of text.

Structure that works:
1. Hook (specific, concrete)
2. The insight or tension
3. Connection to work/tech/consulting (if natural)
4. Land it clean - no "what do you think?" endings

### 4. De-AI-ify Pass

Run through the draft checking for:

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "I see this..." / "I've noticed..." | State directly |
| "That's when I realized..." | Cut or rephrase |
| "It's worth noting that..." | Just note it |
| "Here's the thing:" | Delete, continue |
| Italics on abstract words | Remove emphasis |
| Two parallel structures in a row | Keep one |
| Ending with a question | End with statement |

### 5. Final Check

- Does it sound like something you would actually post?
- Is there a real point, not just vibes?
- Would it survive the "read it out loud" test?

## Examples

See `examples/` for reference posts showing the voice in action.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Corporate announcements (use professional tone, not personal voice)
- Job postings or company updates
- Anything requiring legal/compliance review
