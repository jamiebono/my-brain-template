# Outreach

> Track your outreach efforts, draft messages, and follow-ups.

**See also:** [[network]], [[todo]], [[roadmap]]

---

## Outreach Principles

> Good outreach creates value for both parties. Keep these in mind:

**Do:**
- Ask specific questions (more specific = better)
- Ask for criticism (often > advice)
- Share something interesting or useful
- State your intention clearly
- Keep it under 200 words
- Reference specific work they've done

**Avoid:**
- General life advice requests
- Too many questions at once
- Fake professional tone
- Long-winded explanations
- Ambitious asks without context
- AI-generated phrases that feel inauthentic
