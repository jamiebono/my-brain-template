# Example: Clocked Screws Post

**Final post:**

> There's a woodworking practice called "clocking" screws - lining up all the slots vertically for visual consistency. Lost Art Press has a good piece on why it doesn't actually matter.
>
> The author clocks their screws. But they don't think it makes them better than someone who doesn't.
>
> Doing something a certain way is different from believing your way is superior.
>
> Tech has its own clocked screws. Code style wars. Framework tribalism. "You're not using [hot new tool]? Good luck with that."
>
> The screws don't care which way they face. The joint holds or it doesn't.
>
> I have personal standards. But when I start thinking my preferences make me better than someone who ships working software differently, I've confused ritual for craft.
>
> The work speaks for itself.

**Why it works:**
- Opens with specific, concrete practice (not "In the world of craftsmanship...")
- States the insight directly without announcing it
- Tech connection is natural, not forced
- "Good luck with that" - uses voice/attitude instead of description
- Ends clean on a statement, no engagement bait
- 140 words - respects reader's time
